# Overview:

The Credit Card Report project aims to provide comprehensive insights into credit card transactions, customer spending patterns, and financial trends using data visualization techniques. 
This project utilizes Power BI for interactive reporting and SQL for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.


# Key Objectives:

Data Collection and Integration: Extract transaction data from multiple sources using SQL queries. Integrate and cleanse data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Data Modeling: Design a robust data model in SQL Server or another relational database to support complex reporting requirements. Normalize data to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.

Dashboard Creation: Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics such as transaction volumes, average spend, credit limits utilization, and fraud detection trends.

Customer Segmentation: Implement segmentation techniques to categorize customers based on spending behavior, credit history, and demographic data. Analyze segment-specific insights to tailor marketing strategies and risk assessment.

Performance Monitoring: Implement KPIs and metrics to monitor credit card portfolio performance. Track indicators such as delinquency rates, charge-off rates, and profitability metrics.

Ad Hoc Analysis: Enable ad hoc reporting capabilities in Power BI for stakeholders to explore data dynamically. Incorporate slicers, filters, and drill-down functionalities for deeper insights.

Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) in data handling and reporting processes. Implement data anonymization techniques where necessary.
